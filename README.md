# hackgme2022
A repository for organizing and reporting results of the Genetic Mechanisms and Evolution Hackathon

## About

The Genetic Mechanisms and Evolution (GME) T32 training grant will host a hackathon 
Sept 20th-21st 9am-5pm, with a post-hackathon debrief session on Sept 22st from 3:30-
5pm.  The goal of the hackathon is for students to enjoy curiosity-driven inquiry and 
exposure to new skills in the context of an unfamiliar problem relevant to genetic 
mechanisms and evolution.  Graduate students, postdocs, faculty are welcome to 
participate.

As the broad topic area for this year - students are invited to form teams that will address 
problems related to the genetics/genomics of loci with relevance to malaria progression 
and resistance.  A meta-goal is that the collection of projects will provide an integrative 
perspective on the genetic mechanisms governing the structures, genetic regulation, 
evolution, and phenotypic consequences of variation in these loci.  Potential areas that 
may be of interest include exploration of coding sequence evolution, comparative 
regulatory genetics of the genes affecting malaria progression, linkage disequilibrium 
between regulatory and structural variants, the evolutionary trajectories of allele 
frequencies in ancient DNA datasets, assembly of novel coding sequences from newly 
sequenced non-model organism genomes, intersecting an evolutionary perspective with 
genome-wide association studies and polygenic predictors of hemoglobin levels.  
Attendees will be encouraged to pick a project that is an intersection of their internal 
curiosities and skill-sets that they hope to practice.

## Organization of this repository

- `doc` contains background literature and a description of data resources made avaialble. After the hackathon, rendered analysis notebooks will also appear here, with a subdirectory for each team.
- `data` the hackathon organizers have curated publicly available data sets relevant to hackathon theme. These data are too large to host on github, but are made available to participants on the RCC. This directory contains scripts for downloading and subsetting the data.
- `analysis` this is where hackathon participants will work. Individual teams are encouraged to create a fork of this repository and conduct their analysis here.
